# turing-machine-examples

Python Turing machine examples to see how they do some simple operations. This
is just a test of the chapter about Turing machines in the book:
 Fundamentals of Discrete Math for Computer Science, A Problem-Solving Primer,
 Tom Jenkyns & Ben Stephenson
I just wanted to test the chapter content and learn a bit of Python by the way.
Do whatever you want with this code!
